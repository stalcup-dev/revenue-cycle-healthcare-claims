This project uses CMS DE-SynPUF synthetic claims data to demonstrate an enterprise-ready Revenue Cycle analytics system (warehouse + semantic layer + QC gates + KPI marts + triage workqueue). Dollar impacts are illustrative because the dataset is synthetic and does not include a full provider remittance/workflow ledger (e.g., detailed submission/appeal touchpoints). “Observed payer-paid” reflects payer-side payments captured in the Carrier schema (Medicare trust fund + other primary payer where present) and excludes patient cost share; negative paid components are tracked as recoupment rather than netted into paid. Denial dollars are estimated via a conservative “Denied Potential Allowed $” proxy when submitted charges are unavailable.
