# Success Metrics for Workqueue

**Primary:**
- Yield gap closure rate (within 30 days of entering queue)

**Secondary:**
- Reduction in stuck mature claims count
- Reduction in comparable-line denial rate (cohort-based)
- Faster time-to-resolution proxy

**Guardrails:**
- No increase in recoupment/overpay
- Stable mix of claim types and denial categories

These metrics ensure the workqueue delivers real operational impact, not just improved ranking or analytics.
