# Trust Layer (NB-01) - Metric Lineage + Guardrails

This page explains where KPIs come from and why the rest of the decision pack is safe to interpret.

## What you should take away
- Metrics used in NB-03/04/05 are sourced from marts outputs (not ad-hoc notebook transforms).
- Definitions + flags prevent partial-week and incomplete-window misreads.
- This is the receipt layer before any decision memo.
