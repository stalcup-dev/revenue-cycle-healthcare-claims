# Drivers (NB-04) - Pareto of contributors (marts-only)

## Concentration
Top driver accounts for 60.0% of total contribution (based on denied_potential_allowed_proxy_amt).
Top 5 contributors account for 100.0% of total contribution (based on denied_potential_allowed_proxy_amt).
Proof: top5_sum=20000.0, total_sum=20000.0, share=100.0%.

## Interpretation guardrail
Contribution/composition, not causality.

## Action path
- If top driver share > 60% (dominated): verify the top driver workflow before scaling.
- If top driver share <= 60% (distributed): validate mix across top 5 drivers and prioritize consistent contributors.
