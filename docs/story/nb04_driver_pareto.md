# Drivers (NB-04) - Pareto of contributors (marts-only)

## Interpretation rule
Drivers show contribution/composition, not causality.

## Visuals
![Driver Pareto](../images/nb04_driver_pareto.png)
Interpretation: Contribution view for the latest period; use it to prioritize where to look first.

![Top 10 Driver Bar](../images/nb04_driver_top10_bar.png)
Interpretation: Shows the biggest contributors and whether the tail is material.

![Top Driver Trend](../images/nb04_driver_timeseries_top1.png)
Interpretation: Shows if the top driver is persistent vs a one-period spike.

## What to do next
If interpretation status is STABLE: proceed to NB-05 workqueue prioritization.
If INVESTIGATE: validate mix/volume shifts before queue expansion.
