- Problem: Weekly KPI shifts risk false signals due to mix/partial-week effects; Method: marts-only decision router with explicit triggers; Artifact: exec summary + decision memo + story pack; Decision: route to driver analysis or queue allocation; Guardrail: contribution is not causality and proxy ranking is not recovery.
- Problem: Execs need fast clarity on what moved; Method: structured decision memo with options and tradeoffs; Artifact: docs/decision_memo_latest_complete_week.md; Decision: hold vs proceed based on router status; Guardrail: comparator/partial-week gating.
- Problem: Driver lists can imply causality; Method: Pareto concentration with computed shares; Artifact: docs/story/nb04_driver_pareto.md; Decision: verify dominant driver vs broaden focus; Guardrail: composition only.
- Problem: Workqueue previews can overwhelm on screen share; Method: reduce to the 5 most relevant columns and add capacity framing; Artifact: docs/images/nb05_workqueue_top25.png + docs/story/nb05_workqueue.md; Decision: pick capacity target; Guardrail: proxy-based triage only.
- Problem: Recruiters need a quick walkthrough; Method: visual-first story index; Artifact: docs/story/README.md + key images; Decision: follow trust -> overview -> drivers -> queue; Guardrail: no pipeline claims, marts-only.
