# Hiring Showcase Brief

## Executive question
Where did the most recent week move, is it stable enough to act on, and what is the next operational decision?

## Canonical sources
- [Decision Standard](DECISION_STANDARD.md)
- [Executive Summary](executive_summary.md)
- [Decision Memo](decision_memo_latest_complete_week.md)
- [Story Index](story/README.md)

## Decision pattern (canonical)
- Use [Decision Standard](DECISION_STANDARD.md) for status definitions and HOLD -> EXPAND criteria.
- `LIMITED_CONTEXT` means reversible actions only (validate, segment, triage).
- Do not scale staffing/process changes until comparator validity and persistence checks pass.

## Guardrails
- Driver charts show contribution/composition, not causality.
- Workqueue ranking is proxy prioritization, not guaranteed recovery.
